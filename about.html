    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello everyone! My name is Kuo Yu Lu, but you can call me Lu. I am
      studying Computer Programming remotely and currently living in Woodbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Taiwan and have studied in Switzerland, the United States,
      and Canada. For my hobbies, I love playing video games, creating random
      things, and snowboarding when I was younger. My favorite games are the
      Bioshock, Borderlands, and Fallout series. I also enjoy musicals, my
      favorites are Hamilton, Wicked, and Hadestown.

    <p>
      I worked as a 2D Cutscene Designer for a few years and am now seeking a
      new path in programming.

      It’s nice to meet everyone here! I’m looking forward to learning more
      about you all!
